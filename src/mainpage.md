   @section sec_intro   Introduction
                        This page documents the code for the Pen Plotter, the term project for ME 405: Mechatronics II.
                        This pen plotter is capable of moving two motors to draw, using polar coordinates converted from HPGL
                        files from Inkscape.
                        A video of the plotter's function can be found [here].
