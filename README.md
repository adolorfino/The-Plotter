# The Whiteboard Plotter

## Our Project
At the end of the term our team developed a Whiteboard Plotter to translate HPGL files into physical drawings on a whiteboard. The goal was to be able to hand draw a single line image using inkspace and then be able to use our plotter to draw a similar image on the whiteboard. With out final design we were able to sucessfully plot a handful of images. The purpose of our device was to be a simple plotter that almost anyone in our class could operate. We wanted our plotter to be something easy for a person with limited knowledgable in mechatronics to understand. Based on our hardware and software design a person would first set our plotter in it's starting position: as far clockwise on the whiteboard the pen would got and with the pen carrier closest to the main axial. Then the user can draw a single line image in inkspace. They would save the drawing's coordinates as a text file which they would enter in line 198 in the main file of our software. All that's left is to run the main file and then turn on power to the plotter and the image should be drawn on the whiteboard.

## Hardware Design
Majority of our plotter ws made from scraps found in the Mechatronic Lab or already in our ME405 Tub. The main outliers were the two motor connecters we 3D printed and the threaded rod set we bought from amazon. We have a more detailed breakdown our our materials in the "Bill of Material" section of the README below. Additionally, we added the CAD model references from which we built our final hardwar from in the "CAD Model" section of the report.
