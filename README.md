# The Simplified Cricut

## Our Proposal
For our term project we plan to make our own simplified version of a Circut with the end goal of having the machine be able to
cut paper so we could construct a 3D light box. The cutting would be done by attaching some sort of engraving needle or small dremel
to a high speed DC motor, the spinning motion of the needle or dremel should provide enough friction to cut through cardstock. The 
DC motor itself would be attached to an arm controlled by two motors to allow the DC motor to move around a 6x6 area. One motor would 
act as a pivot point for the arm, allowing it to move in a windshield wiper motion, and the other motor would be attached to a threaded
rod and control how far the DC motor sits on the arm. The arm would made form aluminum unistruct and be located on the the back left 
corner of the the 6x6 workspace, stratching to a length of 10 inches so the DC motor mechanism can reach all parts of the the workspace.

To construct the final 3D light box we need our simplified Circut to cut multiple layers of cardstock according to the images found on this 
downloadable 3D light box template (https://blog.createandcraft.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Layered-Bauble-Templates-and-Instructions.pdf).
Then by using inkspace to translate these images to G-code, as done in this youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbe56S_O-uI), 
we should be able to feed our simplified Circut the G-code and cut out the desired images. All that's left to do is take the cut out images 
and constuct the actual 3D light box by had with some of the leftover cardstock and glue.
