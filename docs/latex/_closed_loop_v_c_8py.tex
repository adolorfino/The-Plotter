\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A closed loop controller with both position and velocity controls. 

The motor takes the location and specified setpoint of the motor and uses that information to calculate a duty cycle appropriately using a proportional gain. The velocity controller is used until the velocity controller reaches a set threshold, then switches to position for an accurate location.
